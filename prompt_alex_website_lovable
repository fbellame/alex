Challenges Faced
Challenges Faced
The system faced challenges in speech recognition due to patients having various accents and producing speech hard to understand.

Challenges Faced
Users benefited from improved results whenever their dialogues with the system included both responding to interruptions and programmed replies.

Challenges Faced
The maintenance of user engagement relied heavily on making the AI system sound like a human voice instead of robotic speech tones.

Challenges Faced
Voice recognition needed accurate separation of background distractions and main dialogues in order to function properly.

Solution
Solution
Auralie, developed by BOSC Tech Labs, addresses key challenges by leveraging advanced AI and NLP algorithms. To provide smoother interactions, the system uses voice recognition technology capable of filtering out background noise and understanding various accents. Interruptions during calls are managed with a sophisticated conversation flow algorithm that provides smooth transitions.
